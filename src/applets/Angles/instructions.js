			Angles.yum is a fun game to help you master the <strong>Unit Circle</strong>.<br />
			<hr />
			<br />
			Your angle is the <span style={{ color: '#61C0BF' }}>teal</span> colored pac-man looking
			object.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Gain</strong> points by making it so your angle matches the angle shown above the
			board. You can make your angle grow and change by eating other angle measurements on the
			board.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong> But be careful...</strong>
			<br /> If another measurement runs into your angle, you might just grow when you don
			{"'"}t want to!
			<br />
			<br />
			Hepful Tip:
			<br />
			If none of the measurements on the board have what you need, click the Reload Values Button in
			the top right corner!
